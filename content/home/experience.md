  My internship in the Airbus "Test" department was divided into two missions:
  
  Data Science: Detection of anomalies in flight test data to diffentiate OK and KO sensors
  - Data collection
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data cleaning
  - Model building to differentiate OK and KO sensors 
  
  Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib + Seaborn, Sklearn (Pipelines, StandardScaler, PCA, K-Mean), Jupyter
  
  
  Configuration Management Improvement:
  
  - Identification of item linked to Configuration Management for Lab Test (process)
  - Understanding of the AS-IS situation and associated difficulties in the Lab Test Centre
  - Identification of current needs and requirements of Configuration Management for Lab Tests
  - Proposition of a mock-up for Test benches configuration tool

  I joined the Altran Sud-Ouest "System Installation" department to optimize A350 part.
  - Finding appropriate part according to its characteristics (weight, cost, size, number of parts)
  - Structural and material modifications to reduce weight and cost (HyperMesh)
  - Sizing of new structure (Nastran)
  - Automation tool creation for the extraction of calculation results (VBA)
  
  Result: 50% weight reduction and 15% cost reduction of a part
