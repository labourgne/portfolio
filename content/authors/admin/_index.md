I am an Electrical and Electronics Graduate, currently doing my Master's in Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, with a special focus on applications of Machine Learning in Industrial Automation.

My Master Thesis is focussed on developing a novel Regularization Algorithm for Multi-Task Lifelong Learning in Deep Neural Networks. Additionally, I am working as a Research Assistant and have a vast experience in devising algorithms for Condition Monitoring, Predictive Maintenance and Computer Vision.

I am proficient in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Visualization. I am passionate about research involving Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence.
