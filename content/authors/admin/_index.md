Holder of a Generalist Engineering Degree from the Institut Catholique d'Arts et Métiers (ICAM), I continued my studies by integrating the Advanced Master "Aerospace Project Management" at ISAE-SUPAERO in Toulouse. 

In addition, I took online courses (MOOC) with the University of Michigan and DeepLearning.AI to specialise in Data Science (Data Processing, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Text Mining, Deep Learning) and the use of Python.

I am looking for a job as Data Scientist. Available and highly motivated, I am ready to take up new challenges.
